# liteburner
A lightweight CD &amp; DVD burning application written in Tcl/Tk

This project is a (very minor) fork of the TkDVD application from http://regis.damongeot.free.fr/tkdvd/

Most of the original code remains unchanged.

This fork was created for two reasons:
  - The original author hasn't published a new release since 2009
  - The original software is unable to burn large files (>2GB) to DVD

This project has two main goals:
  - Implement a fix to overcome the 2GB file size limitation
  - Gradually tweak and improve the code over time
