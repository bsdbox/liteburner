# liteburner
A lightweight CD &amp; DVD burning application written in Tcl/Tk

This project is a fork of the TkDVD application from http://regis.damongeot.free.fr/tkdvd/

Most of the original code has been unchanged. This fork was motivated by the need for a lightweight DVD authoring program that can run on OpenBSD and is able to burn files larger than 2GB to DVD. The original application was limited to files <= 2GB.
